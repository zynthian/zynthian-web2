TAL-U-NO-LX is a synthesizer plug-in that faithfully recreates the iconic sound of the analog Juno 60 synth. Each
oscillator, filter, and envelope has been painstakingly modeled to capture the essence of the original hardware,
delivering an unparalleled level of authenticity.

TAL-U-NO-LX is proprietary software developed and commercialized by TAL (Togu Audio Line). Zynthian includes a limited
demo version that allows to have a taste but it's not suitable for production use. If you want to unleash the full power
of this fantastic plugin, you can buy a license at [TAL's website](https://tal-software.com/products/tal-u-no-lx).

##Authenticity

TAL-U-NO-LX faithfully captures the warmth, richness, and nostalgic charm of the hardware device. The true Juno's
signature sound, including its emulated inaccuracy and incredibly smooth filter response. This plugin was meticulously
calibrated after a real Juno-60, ensuring an unparalleled level of sonic authenticity.

TAL-U-NO-LX excels at producing the characteristic sounds of 80s pop, synthwave, and electronic music, from deep,
resonant basses to shimmering pads and bright, cutting leads.

##Sound architecture

TAL-U-NO-LX boasts an impressive array of features that both honor the original Juno-60 and expand upon its
capabilities.

At its heart is a DCO (Digitally Controlled Oscillator) that produces sawtooth and pulse waveforms, with pulse
width modulation for added timbral variety.

The high-pass filter allows for sculpting the low end, while the resonant low-pass filter is crucial in shaping
the synthâ€™s characteristic sound. The filter can self-oscillate, enabling it to be used as an additional sound
source.

The ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) envelope generator provides control over the amplitude and filter cutoff,
allowing for dynamic sound shaping. The LFO (Low-Frequency Oscillator) can modulate the DCO and filter,
creating vibrato, tremolo, and filter sweeps.

One of the most iconic features of the Juno sound is its lush chorus effect, which TAL has painstakingly recreated
in software form. Users can choose between three chorus modes, each adding its own flavor of stereo width and
movement to the sound.

##Beyond Vintage

TAL-U-NO-LX goes beyond simple emulation. It implements state-of-the-art zero feedback delay filters and meticulously
calibrated controls, ensuring exceptional audio quality and a familiar feel for Juno enthusiasts.

It offers additional features that enhance your creative potential:

+ **Portamento:** Glide smoothly between notes for expressive leads and basses.
+ **Expanded Filter LFO Waveforms:** Explore a wider sonic palette with a variety of filter LFO waveforms.
+ **Built-in Arpeggiator:** Create intricate melodic patterns with the versatile arpeggiator, featuring different sync modes and a hold function.
