Neural Amp Modeler is an open-source project that uses deep learning to create models of guitar amplifiers and pedals with state-of-the-art accuracy.

#### Get models from a large community

[Tonehunt.org](https://tonehunt.org) has become the place to get the best models for Neural Amp Modeler, Aida-X and Proteus, while expanding to support more platforms in the future. Not only models, but our collection of IRs is also growing and becoming very popular within the platform.

#### Loading files

From the zynthian-ui you can load model files easily. Simply move the knob assigned to the model control and the file selector will popup.
