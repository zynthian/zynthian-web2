LinuxSampler is a software sampler synthesizer that supports several soundfont file formats, specially GIG & SFZ.

Among its goals are having high stability, high efficiency and very low latency, providing professional grade features comparable to both hardware and commercial Windows/Mac software samplers.

It's capable of streaming audio samples directly from disk, what allows to manage soundfont files much bigger than the available physical memory.
