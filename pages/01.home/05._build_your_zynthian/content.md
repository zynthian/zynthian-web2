You can build your own unit and learn how it works. Don't be afraid! It's an easy task that anybody can carry out, and you get a bunch of advantages by doing this way:

+ You learn how it works.
+ You can repair your unit. Every single part is available separately.
+ You can customize your unit, adapting it to your needs.
+ You can upgrade your unit, re-using parts, reducing waste and saving money.

If you don't feel comfortable building your own zynthian unit, now you can also buy it fully assembled and ready to use.

Finally, if you are a brave maker and have time and energy, you could build your zynthian from scratch. The specifications and schematics are freely available in the github repositories and you would find several tutorials in the wiki and guidance in the zynthian forum.
