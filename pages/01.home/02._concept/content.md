[div class="pre-title"]<h2>Concept</h2> ![](circle-concept.svg?classes=show-small)[/div]**Zynthian is a compact, self-contained, music-making computer that can be used as a keyboard expander, audio effects unit, MIDI processor / router and groovebox / micro-DAW.**<br>
<br>
Zynthian is a [community-driven project](https://discourse.zynthian.org?target=_blank) and it's 100% open source. Free software on Open hardware. Completely configurable and fully hackable! **Free as in Freedom.** You can [build your zynthian from scratch or buy an official DIY kit](#build-your-zynthian).<br>
<br>
Zynthian's software includes:

+ **[over 30 synth engines](/engines#synthesizers)**:
 + **accurate emulations of classic instruments:**<br>
pianos, electric pianos (rhodes, wurly, clavinet, ...), hammond organ, combo organ, pipe organ, DX7, oberheim, Juno 60, ...
 + **amazing virtual analog synthesizers:**<br>

 + **soundfonts:**<br>
 SF2, SF3, SFZ & GIG formats are supported. 4GB of soundfonts included.
+ **[over 500 audio effects](/engines#effects)**, including reverb, delay, echo, chorus, distortion, EQ, compressor, wahwah, flanger, phaser, granulator, vocoder, auto-tune...
+ **[neural network modelling](/engines/_engine-list/engine-aidax)** for accurate emulation of non-linear gear like amplifiers, distortion, fuzz, overdrive stomp-boxes, etc.
+ **[impulse response modelling](/engines/_engine-list/engine-aidax)** for reverb and cabinet emulation.
+ **midi filters & tools:** map, chorder, strum, arpeggiator, LFO, sequencer, quantization, split, velocity map, ...
+ **step sequencer:** zynseq is a full featured step sequencer that turns zynthian into a powerful groovebox. It features live capture, quantization, swing, humanization, playing chance and much more.
